        This popup is running on a different domain. With normal Javascript it wouldn't be able to communicate with your domain. However, with
        PM.js we can. Click the link below to simulate a user authentication, like Facebook and Google's authentication popup, and see the user information in
        the main domain.

    <button onclick="authenticate();">Authenticate with FakeBook</button>
