Using the Sample Files
======================

1. Make sure you're running a webserver, such as Apache. Point a virtualhost to the PM folder.

2. Edit your hosts file to create otherdomain.com and mydomain.com, pointed to 127.0.0.1.

3. Open your browser to the website's URL: http://mydomain.com/sample/

Note: http://mydomain.com/sample/index.html will access http://otherdomain.com/sample/otherdomain/index.html
    Both domains should point to the same location.

If you're using alternative ports or domains, please modify the examples to your liking.
